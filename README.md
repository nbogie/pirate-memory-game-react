### TODO:

-   animate treasure sliding towards the relevant player when they are awarded it
-   add sound for treasure pick-up
-   show treasure cards in player area

-   Sound: down-play the "no-match" sound (much shorter, perhaps percussion)
-   Alternative Sound: consider using 5 pitches for the 5 different backgrounds, on 5 instruments for the 5 animals. That way the game could be played somewhat by ear. However, the frequently-changing instrument will likely be annoying.

### DONE:

-   Lay out players on two, three, or four sides of the card grid.
    -   show them being grayed out when they are eliminated
